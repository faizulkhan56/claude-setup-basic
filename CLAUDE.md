```

**Where things belong:**
- New routes → `app.py` only, no blueprints
- DB logic → `database/` only, never inline in routes
  - connection, schema, or `users` work → `db.py`
  - anything querying `expenses`, or shaping profile data → `queries.py`
- New pages → new `.html` file extending `base.html`
- Page-specific styles → new `.css` file, not inline `<style>` tags
- Deployment artifacts → created per phase by `/deploy-phase`; paths are listed in
  `.claude/skills/spendly-devops/SKILL.md`. Update this tree when they first appear.

---

## Code style

- Python: PEP 8, snake_case for all variables and functions
- Templates: Jinja2 with `url_for()` for every internal link — never hardcode URLs
- Route functions: one responsibility only — fetch data, render template, done
- DB queries: always use parameterized queries (`?` placeholders) — never f-strings in SQL
- Error handling: use `abort()` for HTTP errors, not bare `return "error string"`

---

## Tech constraints

- **Flask only** — no FastAPI, no Django, no other web frameworks
- **SQLite only** — no PostgreSQL, no SQLAlchemy ORM, no external DB
- **Vanilla JS only** — no React, no jQuery, no npm packages
- **No new pip packages** — work within `requirements.txt` as-is unless explicitly told otherwise
- Python 3.10+ assumed — f-strings and `match` statements are fine

**The one sanctioned exception — approved and landed.** Deployment needs a WSGI
server, because `app.run(debug=True)` exposes the Werkzeug debugger (remote code
execution) and must never face the internet. `gunicorn==23.0.0` therefore lives in
**`requirements-prod.txt`**, which is `-r requirements.txt` plus that one pin.
`requirements.txt` is unchanged and stays that way.

- Local dev: `pip install -r requirements.txt`, run `python app.py` — unaffected
- Deployed: `pip install -r requirements-prod.txt`, and the container `CMD` invokes
  `gunicorn ... app:app`, so the `__main__` block never executes
- **gunicorn does not run on Windows** (it needs `fcntl`). It installs fine, but it
  only *runs* inside the Linux container. On a Windows host keep using `python app.py`.

Any other new package still needs an explicit ask.

---

## Subagent Policy
- Always use a builtin explore subagent for codebase exploration 
  before implementing any new feature
- Always use a subagent to verify test results 
  after any implementation
- When asked to plan, delegate codebase research 
  to a subagent before presenting the plan
- always use a builtin plan subagent in plan mode

### DevOps requests route automatically

Any request about deploying, containerising, hosting, provisioning,
scaling, backing up, or automating the release of Spendly is DevOps
work — whether or not the user names a phase or knows a command exists.
"Can you dockerize this", "put it on EC2", "why is my pod pending",
"set up GitHub Actions" all qualify.

For those requests:

1. **Load the `spendly-devops` skill first.** Never write a
   Dockerfile, manifest, nginx config, or workflow from general
   knowledge — the skill carries traps specific to this repo (the
   hardcoded DB path, the import-time demo seed, the single-writer
   ceiling, the committed `.db` files).
2. **Delegate to a subagent, do not do it inline:**
   - `spendly-devops-engineer` to build artifacts and phase-0 code changes
   - `spendly-devops-reviewer` to audit artifacts, read-only
   - Both, in that order, via `/deploy-phase <0|1|2|3|cicd>`
3. **Relay the subagent's `## Handover` block** to the user in your own
   words — what changed, what is verified, what is still open — then
   stop and await direction.
4. **Never commit, push, or mutate live cloud or cluster state** as part
   of a DevOps request. Print the command; let the user run it.

Phase 0 of the skill is a hard prerequisite for phases 1-3. The
`UserPromptSubmit` hook at `.claude/hooks/devops_router.py` injects this
routing reminder automatically, but this policy applies whether or not
the hook fires.

## Claude Code setup

`.claude/` is wired as chains: a slash command orchestrates subagents, and the
subagents load a skill for domain knowledge. Keep these references in sync — if you
rename a command, agent, or skill, update every row below and the files themselves.

| Command | Subagents (in order) | Skill loaded | Writes files? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/create-spec <n> <name>` | `Explore` for codebase research | — | spec + branch |
| `/test-feature <spec>` | `spendly-test-writer` → `spendly-test-runner` | — | `tests/` only |
| `/code-review-feature <spec>` | `spendly-security-reviewer` ∥ `spendly-quality-reviewer` (parallel) | — | no, read-only |
| `/deploy-phase <0-3\|cicd>` | `spendly-devops-engineer` → `spendly-devops-reviewer` | `spendly-devops` | deploy artifacts |
| `/seed-user`, `/seed-expense` | — | — | DB rows only |
| `/ship-feature` | — | — | commits, PR, merge |

**Skills** live in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Directory name must match the
frontmatter `name`, or the skill will not register.

| Skill | Purpose | References |
|---|---|---|
| `spendly-devops` | deploy phases 0-3 + CI/CD | `references/phase-1-docker.md`, `phase-2-cloud-vm.md`, `phase-3-kubernetes.md`, `cicd.md` |
| `spendly-ui-designer` | frontend design language | — (manual invocation only) |

**Hooks** are Python scripts in `.claude/hooks/`, registered in
`.claude/settings.json`. They invoke `python3`; on a machine without it, change the
interpreter name — do **not** add a `|| python` fallback, which would break the
blocking guard (see the note in `settings.json`).

| Hook | Event | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `devops_router.py` | `UserPromptSubmit` | routes DevOps-shaped prompts to the chain above |
| `format_python.py` | `PostToolUse` on Write/Edit | `black` on `.py` files; no-ops if black is not installed |
| `protect_paths.py` | `PreToolUse` on Bash | exit 2 blocks destructive commands against `spendly.db`, `.env`, `migrations/` |

**Verify the wiring after changing anything in `.claude/`:**

```bash
python .claude/verify_setup.py     # 54 checks; exits non-zero on any break
```

It confirms every referenced agent, command, skill, path, DB helper, and route
actually exists, that each skill directory matches its frontmatter `name`, that
`CLAUDE.md`'s route table matches `app.py` in both directions, and that no template
hardcodes a URL. Run it whenever you rename or add a command, agent, or skill —
a broken reference fails silently at runtime otherwise.

**Boundaries between the reviewers** — do not let them overlap:

- `spendly-security-reviewer` — auth, injection, authorization, data exposure in app code
- `spendly-quality-reviewer` — naming, file placement, Flask idiom, maintainability in app code
- `spendly-devops-reviewer` — deployment artifacts only (Dockerfile, manifests, workflows)

## Adding a new feature — the end-to-end loop

The commands chain in a fixed order. Each one has a gate; do not skip ahead.

| # | Step | Command | Writes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Spec + branch | `/create-spec <n> <name>` | `.claude/specs/<NN>-<slug>.md`, `feature/<slug>` |
| 2 | Plan | Shift+Tab ×2 → `Plan` subagent | nothing |
| 3 | Implement | plain prompting | `database/`, `app.py`, `templates/`, `static/` |
| 4 | Test | `/test-feature <NN>-<slug>` | `tests/test_<NN>_<slug>.py` |
| 5 | Review | `/code-review-feature <NN>-<slug>` | nothing — read-only |
| 6 | Verify | `pytest` + `python .claude/verify_setup.py` | nothing |
| 7 | Ship | `/ship-feature` | commit, PR, squash-merge, branch cleanup |
| 8 | Sync docs | manual edit | this file |

Steps 1 and 7 both require a **clean working tree** — commit or stash first.

### Worked example — step 10, export expenses to CSV

Chosen because it exercises every layer without inventing a new one: a query
helper, a route, an ownership check, a template button, and tests. It needs no new
pip package (`csv` and `io` are stdlib), so the tech constraints hold.

**1 — `/create-spec 10 export expenses csv`**
Checks the tree is clean, branches to `feature/export-expenses-csv`, delegates
research to the `Explore` subagent, writes `.claude/specs/10-export-expenses-csv.md`.
Read the spec before continuing; it is the contract the test-writer will use.

**2 — Plan mode.** Shift+Tab twice. The `Plan` subagent is mandatory here per the
Subagent Policy above.

**3 — Implement, bottom-up.** Data layer first so the route stays thin:

- `database/queries.py` — add `get_expenses_for_export(user_id, date_from, date_to)`.
  Reuse the existing `_build_date_filter()` helper. **Return raw values, not
  display strings.** `get_recent_transactions()` deliberately formats amounts as
  `"1,200.00"` and dates as `"03 Apr 2026"` for the profile table; a CSV needs
  `1200.0` and `2026-04-03`. Do not reuse it — that is why this is a new helper,
  and it also has a `limit=10` an export must not inherit.
- `app.py` — add `GET /expenses/export`, logged-in only. Build the CSV with
  `csv.writer` into an `io.StringIO`, return a `Response` with
  `Content-Type: text/csv` and a `Content-Disposition` filename. Scope every row by
  `session["user_id"]` — the query helper takes it as a parameter, same as
  `get_expense_by_id`. Honour `date_from` / `date_to` query args through
  `_parse_date()` so the export matches whatever filter the profile is showing.
- `templates/profile.html` — one link in the filter bar,
  `{{ url_for('export_expenses', date_from=date_from, date_to=date_to) }}`.
  Never a hardcoded path.

This route is the repo's first that returns a file rather than a template. That is
fine — but it is the exception, so say so in the spec rather than letting it look
like a new default.

**4 — `/test-feature 10-export-expenses-csv`**
`spendly-test-writer` writes tests from the **spec**, not from your implementation,
then `spendly-test-runner` executes only that file. Expect coverage of: auth guard
(302 to login), ownership (user A cannot export user B's rows), `Content-Type`,
the header row, and date filtering.

**5 — `/code-review-feature 10-export-expenses-csv`**
Security and quality reviewers run in parallel, then a unified report and an
approval gate. Nothing is edited until you say so.

**6 — Verify.** `pytest` must be green, and `python .claude/verify_setup.py` must
pass — it catches a route added to `app.py` but missing from the table below.

**7 — `/ship-feature`.** Commits, pushes, opens a PR, waits on CI if configured,
squash-merges, deletes both branches.

**8 — Sync this file.** Add the route to the table below, bump the test count in
the Testing section. Stale facts here actively mislead the subagents, which read
this file as ground truth.

### Other features that fit the current structure

`/analytics` is a coming-soon placeholder and is the obvious step 10 — charts must
be inline SVG, since no JS libraries are allowed. Also natural: category filter on
the profile, expense search by description, monthly budget with a cap warning.

### If the feature is infrastructure

Deploying, containerising, or hosting is **not** this loop. It routes to
`/deploy-phase <0-3|cicd>` via the `spendly-devops` skill — see the Subagent Policy
above.

## Routes

All nine roadmap steps are implemented, plus step 10 (CSV export). There are **no
stub routes left**.

| Route | Methods | Access | Step |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | GET | public | — |
| `/register` | GET, POST | public | 02 |
| `/login` | GET, POST | public | 03 |
| `/logout` | GET | public | 03 |
| `/profile` | GET | logged-in | 04, 05, 06 |
| `/expenses/add` | GET, POST | logged-in | 07 |
| `/expenses/<int:id>/edit` | GET, POST | logged-in (owner only) | 08 |
| `/expenses/<int:id>/delete` | POST | logged-in (owner only) | 09 |
| `/expenses/export` | GET | logged-in | 10 |
| `/analytics` | GET | logged-in | coming-soon page |
| `/terms` | GET | public | — |
| `/privacy` | GET | public | — |

Ownership is enforced in the query layer: `get_expense_by_id(id, user_id)` returns
`None` when the row belongs to someone else, and the route then calls `abort(404)`.
Keep that pattern for any new per-resource route.

`/expenses/export` is the only route that returns a file rather than a template — a
deliberate exception, not a new default. It is not per-resource, so its equivalent of
the ownership rule is that `user_id` is a required parameter of
`get_expenses_for_export()` and every row is scoped by it in SQL. It also reuses
`_parse_date()` and clears both bounds on an inverted range, exactly as `/profile`
does, so the two never disagree about which rows are in range.

`/healthz` and `/readyz` do **not** exist yet. They are phase 0 of the deploy path
— see `.claude/skills/spendly-devops/SKILL.md`.

## Testing

```bash
pytest                              # full suite — currently 215 passed, 0 failed
pytest tests/test_06_date_filter_profile.py
pytest -k "test_name"
pytest -s                           # visible output
```

Feature test files are named `test_<NN>_<slug>.py` with underscores throughout —
`test_06_date_filter_profile.py`, `test_07_add_expense.py`,
`test_09_delete_expense.py`. Keep that shape; hyphens break `-k` filtering.

`tests/test_hooks.py` covers the `.claude/hooks/` scripts over their real
stdin/stdout JSON contract. It exists because `protect_paths.py` shipped with five
false positives, each of which blocked an ordinary command:

| Blocked | Why |
|---|---|
| `git add -A` | `dd\b` matched the "dd" inside **add** |
| `echo 'confirm ...'` | `rm\b` matched the "rm" inside **confirm** |
| `-> arrows` in prose | `>` read as a truncating redirect |
| `>/dev/null` | same, on a discard redirect |
| `<noreply@anthropic.com>` | the closing `>` of an angle-bracketed email |

Every verb now needs a **leading** word boundary, redirects exclude arrows,
comparisons, appends and `/dev/*`, angle-bracketed tokens are stripped first, and
`git rm --cached` is allowed because it is index-only. All five are pinned as
tests. Run them after editing any hook.

Note the guard matches substrings of the command text, so it will also block a
command that merely *mentions* a protected path alongside a destructive verb — a
test harness passing `rm spendly.db` as data, for instance. That is why the hook
cases live in a file rather than inline in a shell command.

Test files patch `database.db.DB_PATH` to a `tempfile` **before importing `app`**,
so they never touch the real `spendly.db`. Reuse that pattern — do not add a
`conftest.py` that conflicts with it, and do not rely on `app.config['DATABASE']`,
which the app does not read.

Registration posts `name`, `email`, `password`, `confirm_password`. Login posts
`email`, `password`. There is no `username` field anywhere.

## Warnings and things to avoid

- **Never hardcode URLs** in templates — always use `url_for()`
- **Never put DB logic in route functions** — it belongs in `database/db.py` or `database/queries.py`
- **Never install new packages** mid-feature without flagging it — keep `requirements.txt` in sync
- **Never use JS frameworks** — the frontend is intentionally vanilla
- **FK enforcement is manual** — SQLite foreign keys are off by default; `get_db()` must run `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` on every connection
- The app runs on **port 5001**, not the Flask default 5000 — don't change this
- **`app.secret_key` is hardcoded to `"dev-secret-key"`** and `debug=True` is hardcoded in `__main__`. Fine for local dev, unsafe anywhere else — phase 0 of the deploy skill fixes both. Do not deploy without it.
- **`seed_db()` runs at import time** and creates `demo@spendly.com` / `demo123`. Harmless locally; a working backdoor on any public host.
- **There is no CSRF protection.** `/expenses/<id>/delete` accepts POST, so a third-party page can trigger a delete in a logged-in browser. Known gap — raise it, don't silently add a dependency for it.
- **There is no migration system.** `init_db()` only does `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and never alters existing tables. A schema change means hand-editing a live SQLite file — back it up first with `VACUUM INTO`, never `cp`.
- **The SQLite files are untracked and gitignored** (`*.db`), because they hold real user emails and password hashes. Two consequences: your local database never appears in `git status`, and switching to a branch from before the untracking will delete it from disk. It is recoverable from history — `git checkout 1c738d6 -- spendly.db` — and `python app.py` will otherwise recreate an empty one with the demo seed. **Their prior contents remain in git history from commits before the untracking**; purging that needs a history rewrite, which has not been done.
